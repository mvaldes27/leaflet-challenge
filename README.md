# leaflet-challenge

- This repository utilizes both html and javascript to visualize USGS earthquake data with Leaflet. 
- The earthquake data is plotted based on longitude and latitude, and the data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earthquake by color. I.e. earthquakes with higher magnitudes are larger and earthquakes with greater depth are darker in color. 
- The map includes popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked, as well as a legend that will provides context of colors representing depth.
